# StormsInMEProject

I took a data visualization course during my Master's program. We were tasked to analyze a data set and create different visualizations for different audiences. The written document in this repository is my final write up for the project and provides context to the brochure pdf. 

Visuals in the brochure were created with Power BI. I used RStudio to explore the data.
